# AI-In-2026
This project draws realistic conclusions about AI's impact on enterprise businesses, in the areas of sales, productivity, and the anatomy of businesses.

To answer the following questions:
1. Does AI generated sales outreach actually reduce relplies, and if so, at what point in the conversation?
2. How valueable exactlty are AI productivity gains, where are they the most valuable, and where can we expect to be growth?
3. In which roles, teams, and processes, is AI most impactful?
   
I looked at data from:
1. Enroll email datasets, customer support / ticket conversion datasets.
2. Anthropic / OpenAI Published Task-Level Productivity Estimates, O*NET Task & Skills Databases, the BLS American Time Use Survey (ATUS).
3. Bugzilla Public Bug Databases, CRM & Sales Funnel Datasets.
