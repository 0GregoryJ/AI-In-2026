# AI In 2026: Have AI-adopting companies really seen gains in productivity relative to peers? And if so, how valuable are these gains?
## Summary
This project draws realistic conclusions about AI's impact on productivity across industries. I will look at data from early adopters in technology, finance, retail, and manufacturing. Specifically, I'll compare adoption timing with productivity metrics like AAR per employee, labor costs, asset turnover, feature velocity, inventory turnover, and more, in python, and visualize results in tableau.

I expect to find:
- Operating margin expansions following AI adoption, but before productivity gains.
- Uneven and industry-specific revenue per employee gains.
- Slows, but not reverses, in headcount growth post adoption.
- Productivity gains highest in software and IT firms.
